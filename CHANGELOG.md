# Changelog

All notable changes to stapel-core. Versioning: semver; 0.x may break
minor-to-minor, breaking changes are always listed here.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- Declare `django-cors-headers` as a dependency — COMMON_INSTALLED_APPS /
  COMMON_MIDDLEWARE require it, but pip installs of the wheel did not pull
  it in (worked only in vendored checkouts whose requirements listed it
  explicitly).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- comm layer: Action (`emit`/`on_action`) with transactional outbox,
  Function (`call`/`@function`) with in-process / NATS request-reply /
  HTTP / dotted-path transports, Task (`start`/`status`/`@task_handler`)
  for async named operations with persistent state, retries, deadlines
  and completion events.
- NATS JetStream bus backend (`STAPEL_BUS_BACKEND=nats`) with DLQ,
  publish dedup (`Nats-Msg-Id`) and durable pull consumers.
- `stapel_core.conf.AppSettings` — per-package settings namespaces with
  dotted-path import strings.
- `stapel_core.signals` — business-milestone Django signals.
- `AbstractStapelUser` — subclass to customize the user model without
  forking; feature modules reference `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL`.
- Schema autoload: JSON Schemas from app `schemas/` dirs are registered
  with the comm registries (enforced when `VALIDATE_SCHEMAS` is on).
- `manage.py serve_functions`, `dispatch_outbox`, `sweep_tasks`.

### Changed
- `STAPEL_HOST` replaces `IRON_HOST` (legacy env still honored).
- Auth-service prefix is configurable: `STAPEL_AUTH_SERVICE_PREFIX`
  (admin login redirect, JWKS discovery).
- `STAPEL_SERVICES` admin catalog is overridable via Django setting.
- CSRF: `/api/` requests are exempt only for header-token/service-key
  clients; JWT-cookie browser sessions require the CSRF token or
  `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`.
- Token blacklist fails CLOSED when the cache is unavailable
  (`STAPEL_BLACKLIST_FAIL_OPEN=True` restores the old behavior).
- Kafka consumer: poison messages go to the DLQ instead of wedging the
  partition; offsets commit only after handler/DLQ success.
- HS256 JWT refuses to start outside DEBUG with a missing/default secret.
- Django floor raised to 5.1.

### Fixed
- Timing-safe service API key comparison.
- `OAuthUserData.email_verified` for safe merge-by-email.
